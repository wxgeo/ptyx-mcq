# Manual review of the checkboxes states.
# The number inside square brackets is the document id.
# Then, for each document question, the checkboxes states are given, as displayed on the pdf document.
# For example, 13:01000000 means that for question 13, the checkboxes states are, in the following order:
# UNCHECKED (0), CHECKED (1), UNCHECKED (0), UNCHECKED (0), UNCHECKED (0), UNCHECKED (0), UNCHECKED (0), UNCHECKED (0)
# Note that the questions are numbered as displayed on the pdf (i.e. those are the apparent question numbers,
# not the original ones.)
