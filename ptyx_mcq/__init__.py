ptyx MCQ

This extension enables computer corrected quizzes.

An example:

    #LOAD{mcq}
    #SEED{8737545887}

    ===========================
    sty=my_custom_sty_file
    scores=1 0 0
    mode=all
    ids=~/my_students.csv
    ===========================


    <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

    ======= Mathematics ===========

    * 1+1 =
    - 1

    - conquering Honolulu
    - walking for the first time on the moon

    #    Doing this, we now know the number of questions, the number
    #    of answers per question and the students names.
    #    However, we can't know for know the number of the correct answer for
    #    each question, since questions numbers and answers numbers too will
    #    change during shuffling, when compiling pTyX code (and keeping track of
    #    them through shuffling is not so easy).
    # 2. Generate syntax tree, and then compile pTyX code many times to generate
    #    one test for each student. For each compilation, keep track of correct
    #    answers.
    #    All those data are stored in `latex_generator.mcq_data['answers']`.
    #    `latex_generator.mcq_data['answers']` is a dict

    #    {1:  [          <-- test n°1 (test id is stored in NUM)
